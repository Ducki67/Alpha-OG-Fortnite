**Supply drops** ðŸ“¦

Supply Drops are *special Containers* in Fortnite: *Battle Royale*.  
Originaly: They were introduced in the *Pre-Season*. 

Supply Drops will spawn later into the game at randomized locations within The Storm circle. They will spawn high in the air attached to a Balloon, which can be destroyed to plummet the drop the ground quicker. When the player can access them, they must be opened to spawn loot, and cannot be broken.

**Supply Drop's Loot Pool** ðŸ’¯

Supply Drops grant 1x *Epic* or *Legendary* weapon, along with the corresponding ammo. Additionally, 30x Wood , Stone , and Metal  will drop, alongside some consumables.

*Epic* weapons have a 75% spawn chance and *Legendary* weapons have a 25% spawn chance, making it more likely to receive and *Epic* weapon rather than a *Legendary* weapon.
